# WaterTracker
Water Tracker is a project created for a school project.

Staying hydrated is very important, but sometimes we are busy and forget to drink
water, for that reason we decided to create a water consumption tracker application to
help users to improve their health.
Through the application the user will be able to:
- Track the water consumption daily.
- See the graphics of the water consumption.
- Receive notifications to remind to drink water.
